## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the fake news detection model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your data:**
   - Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format with appropriate columns for text and labels.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook and run through the cells to train and test the model.

3. **Evaluate the model:**
   - Review the model's performance metrics and adjust parameters as necessary.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization:** Visualize data distributions and model performance.
